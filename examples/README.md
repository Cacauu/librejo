##Examples

This directory contains samples of how Librejo can be used in Tent applications. There will be new files added as there are new things implemented in Librejo. 

The long-term goal is to provide an API documentation but as long as Librejo is still work-in-progress, the example files are a better place to have a look when trying to use the library.
