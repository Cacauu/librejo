#Librejo

Librejo is a work-in-progress PHP-Tent-Library using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

Librejo is compatible with Tent 0.3 only, older versions of the Tent protocol are not compatible.

##Installation

**If you already have Composer:**

```composer install --dev```

**If you need Composer:**

```curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install --dev```

As Librejo is still work in progress, there is no documentation or API reference, that is to be done once all the basic functions work as one would expect. 

Librejo is released under BSD 3.0 license, see [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/cacauu/librejo/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for more information.
