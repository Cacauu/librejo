##Examples

This directory contains samples of how Librejo can be used in Tent applications. There will be new files added and existing files updated as there are new things implemented in Librejo. The best way to keep track of these API changes and updates are the commits to this repo.

The long-term goal is to provide an API documentation but as long as Librejo is still work-in-progress, the example files are a better place to have a look when trying to use the library.
